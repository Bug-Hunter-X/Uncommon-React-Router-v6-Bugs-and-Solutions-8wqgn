To fix nested route issues, ensure proper nesting of routes using the `<Outlet />` component. Carefully check for typos and incorrect paths in your route definitions.  Always wrap your routes within the appropriate router provider, like `<BrowserRouter>`. Verify that you're using only one routing library and resolve any conflicting dependencies. For parameter handling, always validate the parameters received from the URL.  Use route parameters consistently, avoiding inconsistencies that might lead to errors.  If using dynamic segments, carefully plan the URL structure and always ensure your components are capable of handling potential undefined parameter values.
