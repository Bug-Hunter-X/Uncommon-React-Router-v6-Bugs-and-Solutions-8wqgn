In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not properly defined or handled, leading to unexpected rendering behavior or navigation problems.  For instance, using `<Outlet />` incorrectly within a parent route can cause child routes to render improperly or not at all.  Improper use of route parameters or dynamic segments can also lead to 404 errors or incorrect page display. Additionally, forgetting to wrap routes with a `<BrowserRouter>` or similar router provider can result in components failing to render correctly.  There's also potential for conflicts if multiple routing libraries are used simultaneously.
